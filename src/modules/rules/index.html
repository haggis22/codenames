        <div class="title">Giving a Clue</div>
        <div class="para">If you are the spymaster, you are trying to think of a one-word clue that relates to some of the words your team is trying to guess. When you think you 
        have a good clue, you say it. You also say one number, which tells your teammates how many codenames are related to your clue.</div>
        <div class="para"><span class="label">Example:</span> Two of your words are <span class="word">nut</span> and <span class="word">bark</span>. Both of these grow on trees, so you say <span class="clue">tree: 2</span>.</div>
        <div class="para">You are allowed to give a clue for only one word (<span class="clue">cashew: 1</span>), but it's fun to try for two or more. Getting four words
        with one clue is a big accomplishment.</div>
        <div class="title">One Word</div>
        <div class="para">Your clue must be only one word. Your clue cannot be any of the codenames visible on the table. On later turns, some codenames will be covered up,
           so a clue that is not legal now might be legal later.</div>

        <div class="title">Making Contact</div>
        <div class="para">When the spymaster gives a clue, his or her field operatives try to figure out what it means. The operatives indicate their official guess when
        one of them clicks on one of the codenames on the board.</div>
        <ul>
            <li>If the field operative selects <strong>a card belonging to his or her team</strong>, the word will be covered with an agent card in that color.
                <strong>The operatives get another guess (but not another clue).</strong></li>
            <li>If the field operative selects <strong>an innocent bystander</strong>, the word will be covered with an innocent bystander card.
                <strong>This ends the turn.</strong></li>
            <li>If the field operative selects a card <strong>belonging to the other team</strong>, the word is covered by one of the other team's agent cards.
                <strong>This ends the turn.</strong> (And it helps the other team.)</li>
            <li>If the field operative selects <strong>the assassin</strong>, the word is covered by the assassin card. This ends the game!
                <strong>The team that contacted the assassin loses.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <div class="para"><span class="label">Tip:</span> Before giving your clue, make sure it doesn't relate to the assassin.</div>

            <strong>The field operatives must always make at least one guess.</strong>
            Any wrong guess ends the turn immediately, but if the field operatives guess a word of their team's color, they can keep guessing.</div>
        <div class="para">
            <strong>You can stop guessing at any time</strong>, but usually you want to guess as many words as the spymaster said. Sometimes you might even
                want to guess <strong>one more:</strong></div>
