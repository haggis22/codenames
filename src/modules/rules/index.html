            <strong>Spymasters take turns giving clues.</strong> After a spymaster gives a clue, his or her team starts guessing. Their turn ends when they
            guess wrong, when they decide to stop, or when they have made the maximum number of guesses for that clue. Then it is the other team's turn.</div>

        <div class="title">Giving a Clue</div>
        <div class="para">If you are the spymaster, you are trying to think of a one-word clue that relates to some of the words your team is trying to guess. When you think you 
        have a good clue, give it to your team. You also give a number, which tells your teammates how many codenames are related to your clue.</div>
        <div class="para"><span class="label">Example:</span> Two of your words are <span class="word">nut</span> and <span class="word">bark</span>. Both of these grow on trees, so you say <span class="clue">tree: 2</span>.</div>
        <div class="para">You are allowed to give a clue for only one word (<span class="clue">cashew: 1</span>), but it's fun to try for two or more. Getting four words
        with one clue is a big accomplishment.</div>

            <strong>Your clue must be only one word.</strong>
             Your clue cannot be any of the codenames visible on the table. On later turns, some codenames will be covered up,
           so a clue that is not legal now might be legal later.</div>
        <div class="para"><strong>Your clue must be about the meaning of the words.</strong> You can't use your clue to talk about the letters in a word
            or its position on the table. <span class="clue">Gland</span> is not a valid clue for <span class="word">England</span>. You can't tie
            <span class="word">bug</span>, <span class="word">bed</span> and <span class="word">bow</span> together with a clue like 
            <span class="clue">b: 3</span> nor with a clue like <span class="clue">three: 3</span>. However...</div>
        <div class="para"><strong>Letters and numbers are valid clues, as long as they refer to meanings.</strong> You can use <span class="clue">X: 1</span> as 
            a clue for <span class="word">ray</span>. You can use <span class="clue">eight: 3</span> as a clue for <span class="word">ball</span>, 
            <span class="word">figure</span> and <span class="word">octopus</span>.</div>
        <div class="para"><strong>You must play in English.</strong> A foreign word is allowed only if the players in your group would use it in an English 
            sentence. For example, you can't use <span class="clue">Apfel</span> as a clue for <span class="word">apple</span> and <span class="word">Berlin</span>,
            but you can use <span class="clue">strudel</span>.</div>
        <div class="para"><strong>You can't say any form of the visible word on the table.</strong> Until <span class="word">break</span> is covered up by a card,
            you can't say <span class="clue">break</span>, <span class="clue">broken</span>, <span class="clue">breakage</span> or <span class="clue">breakdown</span>.
            <span class="apology">[ The computer will sometimes cheat at this - sorry. :) ]</span></div>
        <div class="para"><strong>You can't say part of a compound word on the table.</strong> Until <span class="word">horseshoe</span> is covered up,
            you can't say <span class="clue">horse</span>, <span class="clue">shoe</span>, <span class="clue">unhorsed</span> or <span class="clue">snowshoe</span>.</div>
        <div class="para">Rhymes are always valid when they refer to meanings. <span class="clue">Snail</span> is a valid clue for <span class="word">mail</span> because
            this rhyme is a common phrase. <span class="clue">Snail</span> is also a valid clue for <span class="word">whale</span> because they are both animals.
            <span class="clue">Snail</span> is not a valid clue for <span class="word">scale</span> because their main association is through the sound of the words.
            (If someone in your group has a job weighing snails, however, this clue is perfectly fine.)</div>

        <div class="para">
            <strong>You can stop guessing at any time</strong>, but usually you want to guess as many words as the spymaster said. Sometimes you might even

        <div class="para"><span class="word">Nut</span> is a red word. The operative has made 3 correct guesses for the clue <span class="clue">river: 3</span>. She is

        <div class="para">
            <strong>You are allowed only one extra guess.</strong> In the example above, the red operative would be allowed 4 guesses because her spymaster said the number
